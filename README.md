# PRNE
Programming for Network Engineers with Python

In this repository, my goal is to document and preserve the knowledge shared in Cisco's free course, *Programming for Network Engineers* (PRNE). All the scripts included here are directly from the course's curriculum and labs, serving as a comprehensive reference for anyone looking to review or revisit the key concepts and practical examples demonstrated throughout the course.
